Lab1: Cache Simulator
----
Create a simulation program which reads in memory accesses provided in TRACE1.DAT and TRACE2.DAT and simulates a cache response for size stimulus and replacement policy changes. This is done in whatever language we wish. Java was chosen for the sake of familiarity and simplicity for file parsing.
